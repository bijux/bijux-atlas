# Inventory configs

- Owner: `platform`
- Purpose: define the authoritative inventory of config groups, files, owners, and consumers.
- Consumers: configs contracts, registry indexing, and generated configs index output.
- Update workflow: update the inventory entries with the file move or new config, then rerun configs contracts and refresh generated indexes.
