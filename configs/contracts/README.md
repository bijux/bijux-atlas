# Config Contracts

`configs/contracts/` is the canonical SSOT location for repository configuration schemas and contract output schemas.

Rules:
- Add or update schemas here, not in feature subtrees.
- Keep schema IDs stable and versioned.
- Keep JSON deterministic (pretty, sorted where required by contract).
