# CI configs

- Purpose: define CI lane behavior, environment contracts, and execution metadata.
- Consumers: GitHub Actions workflows and `bijux-dev-atlas` CI/reporting commands.
- Update workflow: change the corresponding JSON inputs, then rerun the relevant `bijux-dev-atlas` contracts and CI summaries.
