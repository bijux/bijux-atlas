# OpenAPI

- Source of truth: `src/openapi.rs` (`openapi_v1_spec`).
- Writer binary: `src/bin/openapi.rs` writes canonical stable JSON.
- Versioning: this crate currently emits `v1` spec only.
- Drift rule: CI compares generated bytes to tracked snapshot and fails on mismatch.
- Determinism rule: output must be byte-identical across repeated runs in same commit.
- Transcript v1 routes are included:
  - `/v1/genes/{gene_id}/transcripts`
  - `/v1/transcripts/{tx_id}`
