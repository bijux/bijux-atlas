# Determinism Proof

- Owner: `bijux-atlas-operations`
- Purpose: `document deterministic generation and governance proof points available in-repo`
- Consumers: `checks_ops_final_polish_contracts`
- Authority Tier: `tier2`
- Audience: `reviewers`

## Determinism Proof Points

- Sorted registries and schema indexes
- Generated lineage metadata (`generated_by`, `generated_from`)
- Golden and report drift tests in `bijux-dev-atlas-core`
- Immutable workflow action pins and image digest pinning
- Generated lifecycle metadata and curated evidence coverage checks

## In-Repo Proof Scope

- Static determinism and drift prevention checks
- Reproducible committed examples and golden snapshots

## External Proof Scope

- Hosted CI execution reproducibility
- Cross-machine generation equivalence
- Offline and air-gapped runtime execution proofs

## Enforcement Links

- `checks_ops_generated_lifecycle_metadata`
- `checks_ops_evidence_bundle_discipline`
- `checks_ops_final_polish_contracts`
