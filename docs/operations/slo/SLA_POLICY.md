# SLA Policy (v1)

- Owner: `bijux-atlas-operations`
- Tier: `tier2`
- Audience: `operators`
- Source-of-truth: `ops/CONTRACT.md`, `ops/inventory/**`, `ops/schema/**`

## Current policy

- No public SLA in v1.
- v1 commitments are internal SLOs only.

## Future SLA condition

If SLA is introduced later, it must map 1:1 to existing SLOs with explicit metric and window mapping.
