# Canonical Workflows

Use these canonical pages for core workflows:

- Running locally: [Local Stack (Make Only)](local-stack.md)
- Deploying to kind: [E2E Stack](e2e/stack.md)
- Running k6: [Load k6](load/k6.md)
- Validating observability: [Observability Acceptance Gates](observability/acceptance-gates.md)

All workflow docs should link to these canonical pages instead of deep-linking between random files.

Primary entrypoint target: `ops-full`.
