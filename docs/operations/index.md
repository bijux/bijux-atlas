- Stability: `stable`
- Last verified against: `main@50be979f`
- Reason to exist: provide the canonical operator entrypoint across run, deploy, observe, and incident workflows.

## Operator Entry

1. [Run Locally](run-locally.md)
2. [Deploy](deploy.md)
3. [Observability](observability/index.md)
4. [Incident Response](incident-response.md)
5. [Release](release/index.md)

## What This Page Is Not

This page is not a command reference and not an architecture deep dive.

## Verify Success

Operator workflows are successful when each linked page reaches a concrete verification outcome.

## Next Steps

Use [Reference](../reference/index.md) for exact flags and schemas, and [Runbooks](runbooks/index.md) during incidents.
