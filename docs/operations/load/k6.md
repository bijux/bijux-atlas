# k6 execution

- Owner: `bijux-atlas-operations`
- Type: `runbook`
- Audience: `operator`
- Stability: `stable`
- Last verified against: `main@c59da0bf`
- Reason to exist: provide exact commands for smoke and extended load validation.

## Commands

```bash
make ops-load-smoke
make ops-load-nightly
```

`ops-load-smoke` is the release gate smoke suite. `ops-load-nightly` runs extended coverage.

## Interpreting results

- Pass: latency and error thresholds are within suite budgets.
- Soft fail: non-gating suite misses target, open follow-up issue.
- Hard fail: gating suite misses target, block promotion.

Evidence is written under `artifacts/perf/`.

## Verify success

```bash
make ops-load-smoke
```

Expected result: generated report marks all gating checks as pass.

## Rollback

If a rollout caused the regression, execute [Rollback Playbook](../runbooks/rollback-playbook.md).
