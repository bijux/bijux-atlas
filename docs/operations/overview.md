# Operations overview

- Owner: `bijux-atlas-operations`
- Type: `guide`
- Audience: `operator`
- Stability: `stable`
- Last verified against: `main@2026-03-01`
- Reason to exist: provide the curated operator landing page for install, verification, observability, and incident response.

## Operator path

1. [Run locally (5 minutes)](run-locally.md)
2. [Deploy](deploy.md)
3. [Minimal production overrides](minimal-production-overrides.md)
4. [Install verification checklist](install-verification-checklist.md)
5. [Observability setup](observability-setup.md)
6. [Incident response](incident-response.md)

## What this page is not

This page is not a config key reference and not a contract schema portal.

## Verify success

An operator should be able to install, verify, and diagnose Atlas without leaving the operations section for policy docs.

## Next steps

- [Deploy](deploy.md)
- [Observability](observability/index.md)
- [Runbooks](runbooks/index.md)
