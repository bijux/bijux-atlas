# Writing Rules

## Mandatory

- Do not use first-person collective pronouns.
- Do not use “human vs machine” phrasing.
- Do not use vague verbs like “handle”, “manage”, or “support” without scope.
- Do not leave draft marker prose in published docs.
- Prefer active voice. Passive voice is allowed only when actor identity is intentionally irrelevant.

## Contract Writing

- Define inputs, outputs, invariants, and failure modes.
- Use explicit limits and exact field names.
- Include versioning and compatibility behavior.
- Last-reviewed metadata is automated by git history; do not add manual timestamp fields.
