# Writing Rules

## Mandatory

- Do not use first-person collective pronouns.
- Do not use “human vs machine” phrasing.
- Do not use vague verbs like “handle”, “manage”, or “support” without scope.
- Do not leave TODO/FIXME prose in published docs.

## Contract Writing

- Define inputs, outputs, invariants, and failure modes.
- Use explicit limits and exact field names.
- Include versioning and compatibility behavior.
