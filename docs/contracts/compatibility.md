- Plugin compatibility contract: [`docs/contracts/plugin/umbrella-plugin-contract-v1.md`](plugin/umbrella-plugin-contract-v1.md)
- Artifact compatibility and producer alignment: generated matrix and registry references.

## Generated Matrix

- Umbrella/Atlas matrix: [`docs/reference/registry/umbrella-atlas-matrix.md`](../reference/registry/umbrella-atlas-matrix.md)
- bijux-dna -> bijux-atlas compatibility: [`docs/reference/registry/bijux-dna-atlas.md`](../reference/registry/bijux-dna-atlas.md)
