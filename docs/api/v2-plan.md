# API v2 Plan (Stub)

- Owner: `api`
- Stability: `evolving`

- v2 is not active yet.
- When introduced, v2 will be path-versioned under `/v2/...`.
- v1 remains supported per compatibility/deprecation policy during the v2 rollout.
- v2 will start from a new contract version and explicit compatibility notes.
- Non-goal for now: shipping any `/v2` endpoint in the current release line.
