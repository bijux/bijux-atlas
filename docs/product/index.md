# Product

- Owner: `product`
- Type: `concept`
- Audience: `user`
- Stability: `stable`
- Last verified against: `main@6856280c`
- Reason to exist: define what Atlas is, what it promises, and what it does not do.

## Purpose

Provide the canonical product story: what Atlas is, who it serves, and the promises it keeps.

## Who It Is For

- Users integrating genomic data query workflows.
- Operators running release and incident procedures.
- Contributors extending runtime and control-plane behavior.

## What You Will Find Here

- [What is Bijux Atlas](what-is-bijux-atlas.md)
- [Compatibility promise](compatibility-promise.md)
- [Non-goals](non-goals.md)
- [Release model](release-model.md)

## What This Page Is Not

This page is not an operations runbook and not an API reference table.

## Example

```text
Use Product docs to decide if Atlas fits your constraints.
Use API docs to integrate clients.
Use Operations docs to run the system.
```

## Next steps

Continue with [Operations](../operations/index.md) for runtime workflows or [API](../api/index.md) for client behavior.
Also review [Glossary](../glossary.md) for canonical terms.
