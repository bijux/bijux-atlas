# Development

- Owner: `platform`
- Type: `guide`
- Audience: `contributor`
- Stability: `stable`
- Last verified against: `main@6856280c`
- Reason to exist: provide the canonical contributor path for making safe changes.

## Purpose

Guide contributors through repository structure, CI behavior, control-plane operations, and contribution standards.

## What You Will Find Here

- [Control-plane](../control-plane/index.md)
- [Repository Layout](repo-layout.md)
- [CI Overview](ci-overview.md)
- [Contributing](contributing.md)
- [Toolchain](toolchain.md)
- [Add a check in 30 minutes](../control-plane/add-a-check-in-30-minutes.md)
- [Docs governance](../_internal/governance/index.md)
- [Docs change process](../_internal/meta/docs-change-process.md)
- [Docs taxonomy quick reference](../_internal/meta/docs-taxonomy-quick-reference.md)
- [Where truth lives](where-truth-lives.md)

## Where to ask questions

- Documentation policy and structure: use your team docs governance channel and tag `docs-governance`.
- Control-plane and CI behavior: use your platform engineering channel and include command output.
- Runtime/operator questions: open an issue and label it `ops-docs`.

## Next steps

Use [Architecture](../architecture/index.md) for runtime boundaries and [Doc Conventions](doc-conventions.md) for writing standards.

## Document Taxonomy
