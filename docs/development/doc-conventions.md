# Doc Conventions

- Owner: `docs-governance`
- Type: `guide`
- Audience: `contributor`
- Stability: `stable`
- Reason to exist: provide one-page conventions for writing and maintaining Atlas docs.

## Conventions

- Keep one entrypoint per directory: `index.md`.
- Use kebab-case for all names.
- Include owner, audience, type, stability, and reason-to-exist metadata.
- Keep section indexes curated and below 10 links.
- Put facts in `reference/`; put procedures in `operations/` or `development/`.

## Required Footer Pattern

For core pages, include:

- `What to Read Next`
- `Document Taxonomy`
