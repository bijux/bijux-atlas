# Control Plane

Owner: `platform`  
Type: `guide`  
Audience: `contributor`  
Reason to exist: define stable `bijux dev atlas` command families and ownership boundaries.

## Command Families

- `docs`
- `configs`
- `ops`
- `policies`

## Purpose

The control plane enforces deterministic governance checks and operational orchestration without ad-hoc scripts.
