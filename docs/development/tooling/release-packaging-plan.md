# Release Packaging Plan

## Scope

Defines packaging intent for Python surfaces.

## Plan

1. `bijux dev atlas` stays internal-only for now.
2. `bijux-atlas-py` remains placeholder until user API contracts are stable.
3. External publication (PyPI) requires:
   - explicit compatibility policy,
   - smoke/import CI,
   - changelog and semver process.
