# Scripts Compatibility Policy

When `bijux-atlas-scripts` becomes public, patch releases must remain backward compatible for:

- documented CLI command names,
- documented flags,
- JSON output schemas with required core fields.

Breaking changes require a major version bump and migration guidance.
