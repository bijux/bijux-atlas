# Scripts Compatibility Matrix

Current state: `atlasctl` is internal tooling and is validated against the same repository revision only.

| scripts version | repository version | support |
|---|---|---|
| `0.1.0+<sha>` | matching `<sha>` checkout | supported |
| any other pairing | non-matching checkout | unsupported |

This matrix will be expanded when/if scripts becomes externally versioned.
