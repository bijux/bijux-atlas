# Documentation Style Guide

Owner: `docs-governance`  
Type: `policy`  
Reason to exist: enforce consistent writing, naming, and structure.

## Naming

- Use `kebab-case` for files and directories.
- Use `index.md` as the section entrypoint file name.

## Writing

- Separate page intent by type: `guide`, `concept`, `runbook`, `reference`, `policy`.
- Do not mix tutorial walkthrough and factual reference in one page.
- Keep statements verifiable and linked to canonical sources.

## Structure

- Every page includes owner, audience, type, and reason-to-exist metadata.
- Section navigation is through `docs/index.md` and section `index.md` files only.
