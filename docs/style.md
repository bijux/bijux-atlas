# Documentation Style

- Use concise, concrete language.
- Write for one audience per page: `user`, `operator`, or `contributor`.
- Keep one page type per file: `concept`, `guide`, `runbook`, `reference`, `policy`.
- Use kebab-case for all file and directory names.
- Use `index.md` as the only section entrypoint filename.
- Put commands in fenced code blocks and keep examples executable.
