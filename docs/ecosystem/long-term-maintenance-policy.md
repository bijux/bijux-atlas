- Each project must define supported release lines.
- Maintenance expectations:
  - security patches for supported lines
  - compatibility contract tests stay green
  - policy gates remain mandatory for merges
- EOL policy:
  - announced at least one minor release ahead
  - migration path documented before EOL date
