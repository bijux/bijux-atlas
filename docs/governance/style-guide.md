Owner: `docs-governance`  
Type: `policy`  
Reason to exist: provide concise writing and structure rules for governance pages.

## Rules

- Keep governance pages short, explicit, and enforceable.
- Use stable names and avoid transitional labels.
- Write policies as testable requirements, not aspirations.
- Link to canonical policy files instead of repeating requirements.
