Owner: `docs-governance`

Reason to exist: define the durable principles for documentation quality.

Documentation is treated as a contract surface: precise, testable, and continuously verified.

## Principles

- One canonical source per subject.
- Explicit ownership and review accountability.
- Stable naming and clear reader entrypoints.
- Evidence-based updates over narrative duplication.
