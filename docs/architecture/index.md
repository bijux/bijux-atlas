- Reason to exist: define canonical runtime structure, boundaries, and invariants.

## Purpose

Describe how Atlas is structured so contributors and operators share one durable mental model.

## What You Will Find Here

- [Dataflow](dataflow.md)
- [Boundaries](boundaries.md)
- [Components](components.md)
- [Storage](storage.md)
- [Performance Model](performance-model.md)
- [Architecture Map](architecture-map.md)

## Next Steps

Continue with [Operations](../operations/index.md) for runtime procedures or [Development](../development/index.md) for contributor workflows.
