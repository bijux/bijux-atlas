# Architecture

- Owner: `architecture`
- Type: `concept`
- Audience: `contributor`
- Stability: `stable`
- Last verified against: `main@bdd91bc0`
- Reason to exist: define canonical runtime structure, boundaries, and invariants.

## Purpose

Describe how Atlas is structured so contributors and operators share one durable mental model.

## What You Will Find Here

- [Dataflow](dataflow.md)
- [Boundaries](boundaries.md)
- [Crates map](crates-map.md)
- [Runtime data model](runtime-data-model.md)
- [Storage](storage.md)
- [Performance model](performance-model.md)
- [Query model](query-model.md)
- [Ingest and QC model](ingest-qc-model.md)
- [System graph explained](system-graph-explained.md)

## Next steps

Continue with [Operations](../operations/index.md) for runtime procedures or [Development](../development/index.md) for contributor workflows.
Also review [Glossary](../glossary.md) for canonical terms.
Anchor the product model in [What is Bijux Atlas](../product/what-is-bijux-atlas.md).
