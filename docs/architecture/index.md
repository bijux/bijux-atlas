# Architecture

- Owner: `architecture`
- Type: `concept`
- Audience: `contributor`
- Stability: `stable`
- Last verified against: `main@bdd91bc0`
- Reason to exist: define canonical runtime structure, boundaries, and invariants.

## Purpose

Describe how Atlas is structured so contributors and operators share one durable mental model.

## How to Read This Section

Start with [Dataflow](dataflow.md), then [Boundaries](boundaries.md), then choose either [Runtime Data Model](runtime-data-model.md) or [Storage](storage.md) based on your change scope.

## What You Will Find Here
