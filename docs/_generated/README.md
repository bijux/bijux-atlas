# Generated Docs Policy

Generated documentation must be produced by scripts and committed from deterministic outputs.

## Rule

- Generated documentation files live under `docs/_generated/`.
- Manual edits under `docs/_generated/` are not allowed.

## Current Generated Sets

- Contract mirrors: `docs/_generated/contracts/*.md`
