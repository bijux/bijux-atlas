# Docs operating model

Stable docs require explicit ownership and repeatable review.

## Ownership

- Stable pages must have an owner.
- Section owners are authoritative for quality and correctness.
- Docs metadata SSOT lives in `docs/governance/metadata/`.

## Review requirements

- Every structural doc change must include updated navigation and redirects where needed.
- Every procedure must include verification criteria.
- Reader docs must stay independent from governance machinery.

## Merge quality bar

- Contracts pass.
- Links pass.
- Navigation remains curated.
- New pages include clear purpose and next steps.
