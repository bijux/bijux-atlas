# Bijux Security Response Coordination Policy

- Security reports must use private disclosure channels.
- Cross-project incidents require a named incident coordinator.
- Coordinated release process:
  1. validate impact across umbrella/plugins
  2. prepare patched releases per affected project
  3. publish advisory with fixed versions and mitigations
- Backports are required for still-supported release lines.
