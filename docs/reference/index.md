# Reference

- Owner: `docs-governance`
- Type: `reference`
- Audience: `user`
- Stability: `stable`
- Last verified against: `main@8641e5b0`
- Reason to exist: provide the stable factual portal for Atlas commands, configs, schemas, and contracts.

## Why you are reading this

Facts live here. Procedures do not. Use this section for stable names, keys, schemas, contracts, and inventories that other guides link to.

## Categories

- Commands and automation: [Commands](commands.md), [Command inventory](command-inventory.md), [Make reference](make.md)
- Runtime definitions: [Configs reference](configs.md), [Errors reference](errors.md), [Schemas reference](schemas.md)
- Contracts and registries: [Contracts](contracts/index.md), [Dataset operations](dataset-operations.md), [Repo map](repo-map.md)

## Reading rule

- If you need a procedure, use [API](../api/index.md), [Operations](../operations/index.md), or [Development](../development/index.md).
- If you need a stable definition, link here instead of duplicating prose.
- Machine-readable JSON stays in contract registries and generated artifacts, not in narrative guides.

- [Operations](../operations/index.md)
- [Glossary](../glossary.md)
