Reason to exist: provide the fastest successful local Atlas run.

## What Atlas Is

Atlas is the stable platform surface for operating, evolving, and consuming the bijux ecosystem through explicit contracts, predictable workflows, and verifiable runtime behavior.

## Five Minute Local Run

1. Validate local prerequisites.
2. Start the local stack.
3. Ingest a fixture dataset.
4. Execute one API query.
5. Verify one health or metrics signal.

Use the canonical workflow details in [Run Locally](operations/run-locally.md).
