- Owner: `docs-governance`
- Type: `guide`
- Audience: `user`
- Stability: `stable`
- Last verified against: `main@6856280c`
- Reason to exist: provide the single onboarding path for Atlas documentation.

This is the only onboarding root in `docs/`.

## 5-Minute Mental Model

Atlas turns validated source inputs into immutable release artifacts, serves query reads through a stable API surface, and keeps operational control in `bijux dev atlas`.

## Quickstart

```bash
bijux dev atlas demo quickstart --format json
```

## What You Just Did

You executed the canonical onboarding flow and confirmed a runnable environment. Continue with [Architecture Dataflow](architecture/dataflow.md) for ingest -> artifact -> store -> query -> serve.

## Where the Truth Is

- Behavior and workflows: section indexes under `docs/`
- Factual contracts and schemas: [Reference Contracts](reference/contracts/index.md)
- Runtime and policy settings: [Reference Configs](reference/configs.md)

## Next

- Operator path: [Operations](operations/index.md)
- Contributor path: [Development](development/index.md)
- API client path: [API](api/index.md)
