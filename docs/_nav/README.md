# Navigation Policy

The documentation navigation is explicit and stable by design.

## Rules

- Navigation is defined only in `mkdocs.yml`.
- Automatic page discovery is intentionally not used.
- Category names are fixed: `Product`, `Quickstart`, `Reference`, `Contracts`, `Operations`, `Development`, `Architecture`, `ADRs`.
- Structural changes must update nav in the same change.
