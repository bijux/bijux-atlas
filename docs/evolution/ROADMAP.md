# Evolution Roadmap

Near-term:
- Continue additive schema and API expansions within v1.
- Keep artifact and API compatibility tests as hard CI gates.

Planned major evolution topics:
- v2 canonical transcript policy.
- v2 potential sequence model extensions.
- optional storage layout advances with unchanged external contract.

Non-negotiables:
- No column removal in v1 SQLite artifacts.
- No breaking error-contract changes in v1.
- Backward-compatible cursor decoding in v1.
