# Contract registries

This directory is the only human-facing entrypoint for contract domains enforced by `bijux dev atlas`.

- [Docs](docs/_internal/index.md): documentation structure, metadata, links, and generated artifact contracts.
- [Configs](configs/README.md): config tree, schema, owner, and consumer-mapping contracts.
- [Make](make/README.md): make surface, wrapper, and CI parity contracts.

Executable suites live in `ops/inventory/registry.toml`.
