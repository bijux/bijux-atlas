# Naming Standard

Owner: `docs-governance`  
Type: `policy`  
Audience: `contributor`  
Reason to exist: define durable naming constraints for documentation surfaces.

## Rules

- Use kebab-case for documentation files and directories.
- Use `index.md` as the only directory entrypoint filename.
- Names must describe stable concepts, not implementation timing.
- Do not use transitional words such as `phase`, `task`, `stage`, `round`, `iteration`, `tmp`, or `stub`.
