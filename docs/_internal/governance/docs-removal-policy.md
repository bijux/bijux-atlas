# Documentation Removal Policy

Owner: `docs-governance`  
Type: `policy`  
Reason to exist: ensure safe and explicit documentation removal.

## Removal Rules

- Delete duplicated pages after canonical replacements exist.
- Use `docs/redirects.json` when external references are expected.
- Move to `docs/_drafts/` only when immediate deletion is unsafe.
- Set and enforce expiry dates for quarantined pages.
- Replacement pages must be linked before deletion when a legacy path is externally referenced.
- Keep the indexed docs surface within the approved budget by deleting stale low-signal pages.
