# Docs principles

- Write for the reader role first: API user, operator, or contributor.
- Keep one canonical page per topic; link instead of duplicating.
- Put procedures in operations and development; keep reference pages factual.
- Keep generated artifacts out of reader paths.
- Keep section index pages curated and actionable.
- Always include explicit next steps.
