# Generated artifacts

- Owner: `docs-governance`
- Audience: `contributor`
- Stability: `stable`

This page is the canonical entrypoint for generated docs governance artifacts.

## Canonical artifact dashboard

- [Governance audit dashboard](generated/governance-audit/index.md)

## Scope boundary

- Generated outputs are written under `docs/_internal/generated/` only.
- Reader-facing docs must link to policy pages, not generated blobs.
- CI artifacts remain the source for ephemeral diagnostics.
