# Glossary

- `Atlas`: Deterministic genomics serving platform with contract-governed interfaces.
- `Contract`: Executable or documented rule that defines stable behavior and compatibility expectations.
- `Reader spine`: Small set of entrypoint pages every reader starts from.
- `Runbook`: Operational response guide for diagnosing and mitigating incidents.
- `Reference`: Factual source of truth for commands, configs, schemas, and error definitions.
- `Control plane`: `bijux dev atlas` command surface used for deterministic governance and operational orchestration.
- `Reproducibility`: Property that repeated runs with the same inputs produce stable outputs.
- `Release`: Coordinated lane that publishes validated artifacts.
- `Dataset`: Versioned artifact set consumed by API and runtime surfaces.
- `Stack`: Local or cluster runtime composition used for operations workflows.
- `K8s`: Kubernetes deployment surface for Atlas runtime workloads.
- `Load`: Performance and stress validation workflow and reports.
- `E2E`: End-to-end integration workflows spanning ingest, serve, and observability.
- `Fixture`: Curated deterministic sample data used for repeatable tests.
- `Profile`: Named execution mode with specific policy and resource settings.
- `Lane`: Delivery context (`local`, `pr`, `merge`, `release`) used by contracts and CI.
