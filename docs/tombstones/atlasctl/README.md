# atlasctl Historical Tombstones

This directory is the only allowed location for temporary historical `atlasctl` references after the atlasctl cutoff date defined in:

- `docs/development/tooling/atlasctl-deletion-plan.md`

Rules:

- New `atlasctl` references outside this directory are not allowed.
- Files here are archival notes only, not active operator guidance.
- Migration work should delete tombstone files once the referenced legacy surface is removed.
