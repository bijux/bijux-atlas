# Documentation Philosophy

- Owner: `docs-governance`
- Stability: `stable`

Documentation is treated as contract surface: precise, deterministic, and continuously verified.

Principles:
- Single source of truth per subject
- Explicit ownership metadata
- Stable naming and terminology
- Contract checks in CI

Reference:
- `docs/CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/governance/DOCS_OWNERSHIP.md`
