# Migration Notes

Historical note: the pre-1.0 legacy removal hard reset was completed and `packages/atlasctl/src/atlasctl/legacy` was deleted.

For remaining migration activity, use command-level docs and `legacy-removal-plan.md` only.

## Temporary Status And Expiry

`docs/migration/` is temporary and must converge toward zero open items.

- Expiry target: June 30, 2026.
- After expiry: keep only historical notes and remove active migration playbooks.
- Any extension must be documented by a new decision record under `docs/decisions/`.
