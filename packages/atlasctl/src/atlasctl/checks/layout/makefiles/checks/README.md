# makefiles checks

Concept groups:

- contracts: shape and boundary contracts for makefiles and targets
- safety: dangerous invocation/permission/runtime safety checks
- ownership: ownership and command-allowlist governance checks

This directory stays as a stable entrypoint surface for existing makefile/script invocations.
