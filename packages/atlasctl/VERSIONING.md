# Versioning Strategy

`atlasctl` follows semantic versioning.

- `MAJOR`: breaking command or output-contract change.
- `MINOR`: additive commands, flags, or schema fields.
- `PATCH`: fixes and non-breaking internal refactors.

Current package version source of truth is `packages/atlasctl/pyproject.toml`.
